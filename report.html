    <h1>Report</h1>
    <h2>Raghad Mahmoud Alhoussiny</h2>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The website serves as a platform to showcase the impactful work and mission of the Resala charity organization in Egypt. It provides comprehensive information about Resala's programs and services, including details on how to donate and get involved. In addition to highlighting their initiatives, the website also features a section dedicated to the events organized by Resala, creating a sense of community engagement and celebration. Moreover, the website shares inspiring success stories that demonstrate the positive impact of Resala's efforts on individuals and communities. The structure of the website follows a user-centric approach, prioritizing clear navigation, informative content, and interactive features to engage and connect with visitors, fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation for Resala's work.</p>
    
    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
    <p>In the process of creating the website, I drew inspiration from various sources to ensure a compelling and impactful design. Here are three key sources that inspired me:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Exploring the websites of other successful charity organizations allowed me to gather ideas and insights into effective design and content strategies. By studying the websites of these organizations, I gained inspiration for creating an engaging and user-friendly website for Resala. This research helped me identify best practices, innovative features, and layout designs that could be adapted to suit Resala's specific needs and goals.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Renowned artists who leverage their platforms to champion social causes have inspired me to infuse creativity and passion into the design and storytelling aspects of the website, thereby amplifying Resala's message of compassion and philanthropy.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Guest speakers and industry experts who shared their wisdom and experiences during various seminars and webinars have instilled in me the importance of leveraging digital platforms for social good, propelling me to create a website that not only informs but also inspires action and positive change.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Accessibility</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>I have prioritized clear and concise writing on the website. By using simple and straightforward language, organizing information into paragraphs with one main idea, and avoiding complex sentence structures, I have made the content easily understandable for all users.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Alt Text for Images, providing descriptive alternative text for images to accommodate users with visual impairments and ensure they can access and understand the content.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Maintaining sufficient color contrast to improve readability for users with low vision or color blindness, ensuring that information is accessible to a diverse audience.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Usability</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Logical organization of content and clear navigation menus facilitate easy exploration of the website, ensuring that users can quickly find the information they need.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Feedback forms are available to gather user input and improve the overall user experience, allowing visitors to provide valuable insights and suggestions for enhancement.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Responsive design implementation ensures usability across various devices and screen sizes, providing a seamless browsing experience for users accessing the website from desktops, laptops, tablets, or smartphones.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Learning:</h2>
<p>During the development of my website, I acquired new knowledge and skills:</p>
<ol>
     <li>Mastering CSS frameworks for responsive design: I familiarized myself with CSS frameworks like Bootstrap to streamline the development process and ensure responsiveness across various devices. Through online tutorials and practical application, I learned to leverage pre-built components and grid systems effectively, resulting in faster and more consistent layout creation.</li>
    <br>
    <li>I tried to understand Javascript codes and tried to use a javascript libraries to help me as in the homepage.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Implementing web accessibility standards: Understanding the importance of inclusivity, I dedicated time to learning about web accessibility principles and guidelines. Through research and practice, I acquired knowledge on designing accessible forms, implementing proper semantic markup, and optimizing content for screen readers.</li>
</ol>
    
    <h2>Evaluation I</h2>
     <p>Successful aspects of my work include the intuitive navigation, engaging content, and visually appealing design, which collectively contribute to a positive user experience and effectively convey the mission of Resala. The website's structure and features facilitate easy access to information, encourage user interaction, and inspire visitors to support Resala's initiatives.</p>
    
    <h2>Evaluation II</h2>
      <p>Areas for improvement include optimizing performance for slower internet connections, enhancing mobile responsiveness for seamless browsing on all devices, and expanding content to provide more comprehensive information about Resala's projects and impact. Additionally, I believe that advanced javascript could be used in a better way in parts as the forms in the donations page.</p>
